warp is part of a suite of programs used by Gwene to provide a web
interface to the news spool.

It takes an inn NOV file and transforms it into a file more suitable
for web display.

When viewing a news group on the web, we want to display the different
subjects in an efficient manner.  In addition, we want to be able to
display the contents of each thread separately.

So warp generates two indices and a data area into a single file.

The data area contains sequential data about thread roots -- the
subject, the author, the date, and the article numbers of the articles
in the thread.

The first index has a mapping from article numbers to the data area
position that has data for that article.  This is used for displaying
the complete contents of a thread.

The second index has a mapping from a "page number" to the first
article on that "page" in the data area.  This means that if the web
user wants to see "page five" of the newsgroup (where each page
contains, say, 30 thread roots), the web interface just has to go to
index position five in this file, and then seek to the start position
in the data section.  And then output sequentially the 30 data sets
found there.

So each web query should entail, at most, one file open, and two file
seeks.  With a fast disk system, such as a modern SSD, this should
scale well enough.
